This is a python program that aims to manage an information management system for Pocket Monsters (famously known as Pokemon). A PokeDex is a digital encyclopedia for Pokémon. The primary functions of this program include adding, viewing, and deleting Pokémon entries. This project was created to test and demonstrate my understanding of Python programming.

Instructions: 
1. On the terminal, write the following command: python pokedex.py
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to add, view, or attempt to delete Pokémon entries.

1. Add Pokémon
Allows the user to add new Pokémon entries to the Pokedex.

2. View Pokémon
Enables the user to view existing Pokémon entries.

3. Delete Pokémon
(Note: This function does not work as intended and may have issues removing entries.)
